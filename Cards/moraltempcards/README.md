The MoralTempCard
=================
Before I knew of the existence of Twitter, a year or two back, I wrote a letter to my closest friend about what I then called the moraltemp card. I wrote to him and asked him to please send me as many moraltemp cards as he could. The following is what a moraltemp card consists of:

1. Time-Date-Location.
2. Situation / Context.
and 3. A list of at least three adjectives (qualifying the situation).

The basis for my idea of the moraltemp card came from Hippolyte Taine’s conception of “Moral Climate” or “Moral Temperature” i.e. the moral climate of a given milieu which gives rise to a certain type of artist. Hippolyte Taine believed, it appears, that an artist was tied to the milieu which gave birth to him, and that different milieux or “moral climates” gave birth to different kinds of artists.

My rationale was that if I could obtain enough “moral temperature readings” from all around the world, that I could be completely “on top of things” as an artist. That is, if I received moraltemp cards from all across the globe, I would really have my thumb on the “world pulse”, and could then customize my artistic expression and aesthetic production to SUIT the moral temperature of the world.

It turns out that the mean moral temperature in this world is LUKEWARM. Now I see that Twitter is the perfect place to do my moral temperature readings, for millions of people from every corner of the earth is intentionally publishing a close equivalent to my moraltemp cards (a.k.a. MoralTempCards).

So now all I have to do is check my Twitter Feed and I get a reading of the moral climate in which human souls are basking or bathing. And so I can know what themes people are passionate about or occupied by. As an artist, as a creator of cultural artefacts, as a renewer of cultural values.. with my thumb on the pulse of the world, the possibilities are limitless.

Whilst people are worried about businesses and “third parties” obtaining their personal information to better customize either advertisements or products and services, to better suit the needs of the customer / user.. well, whilst people are worried about others capitalizing on their ever-so-valuable private information, etc., I’m capitalizing on the world economy of symbols and signs, feelings and sentiments, thoughts, activities, updates, ponderings.. and I’m going to be the next Picasso / Dali, so to speak.

I’m not just going to customize some product or service.. I’m going to move you and move you big time. You’re going to fall in love with me and my artistic expression. You will wonder how it is possible for some lonely everyday workaday Canadian man to write and paint and create music that is so powerfully SELF-EVIDENT. You’ll begin to believe that you’ve “heard” my music SOMEWHERE.. that you’ve “read” my writing at some time before now.. and really it’s just me being a Mesmerist, reflecting YOUR UPDATES back to you in a more or less aesthetic formulation.

For I am an Alchemist, I cannot hide the fact. And you will love me. Amen. (Notice: Tongue-in-Cheek not included).
