The MoralTempCard
=================
Before I knew of the existence of Twitter, a year or two back, I wrote a letter to my closest friend about what I then called the moraltemp card. I wrote to him and asked him to please send me as many moraltemp cards as he could. The following is what a moraltemp card consists of:

1. Time-Date-Location.
2. Situation / Context. AND
3. 3. A list of at least three adjectives (qualifying the situation).

The basis for my idea of the moraltemp card came from Hippolyte Taine’s conception of “Moral Climate” or “Moral Temperature” i.e. the moral climate of a given milieu which gives rise to a certain type of artist. Hippolyte Taine believed, it appears, that an artist was tied to the milieu which gave birth to him, and that different milieux or “moral climates” gave birth to different kinds of artists.

My rationale was that if I could obtain enough “moral temperature readings” from all around the world, that I could be completely “on top of things” as an artist. That is, if I received moraltemp cards from all across the globe, I would really have my thumb on the “world pulse”, and could then customize my artistic expression and aesthetic production to SUIT the moral temperature of the world.

It turns out that the mean moral temperature in this world is LUKEWARM. Now I see that Twitter is the perfect place to do my moral temperature readings, for millions of people from every corner of the earth is intentionally publishing a close equivalent to my moraltemp cards (a.k.a. MoralTempCards).

So now all I have to do is check my Twitter Feed and I get a reading of the moral climate in which human souls are basking or bathing. And so I can know what themes people are passionate about or occupied by. As an artist, as a creator of cultural artefacts, as a renewer of cultural values.. with my thumb on the pulse of the world, the possibilities are limitless.
