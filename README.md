quickcards
==========

What is this quickcards repository you wonder? Why did I call it quickcards, and why did I choose to create a repository that seemingly has no code?

The term quickcards actually comes from an old piece of software called Zoomracks. Zoomracks was a database management system for the Atari ST and IBM PC that represented data in a form that was visually represented by a filing card, known as "QUICKCARD"s.

Basically, what I want to do is write software that is as minimalistic as possible. I don't just want to go for elegance and readability: I want to go for code that is the absolute minimum in needs to be to "get stuff done".

Firstly, I want to look at a few things: I want to rewrite a kind of Hypercard system in Python; I want it to be loosely based on the simplest flat file database possible, loosely based also on the simplest blog platform possible, + loosely based on the simplest wiki implementation possible. All in Python.

The paradigm is inspired largely by the work of Paul Otlet, with his Mundaneum, as well as the work of Herman Hollerith (i.e. the Art of Compiling Statistics, he developed a mechanical tabulator based on punched cards to rapidly tabulate statistics from millions of pieces of data, circa 1880s). Also a huge inspiration is the work of Gina Trapani (i.e. inventor of the [todo.txt 2.0 paradigm] (http://todotxt.com/)).
